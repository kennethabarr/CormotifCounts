Description: Cormotif is a useful tool for identifying patterns of shared
	DE between experiments, but was designed with Microarray's in mind. It
	uses limma, but does not take advantage of precision weights provided
	by voom. This package provides small updates to the Cormotif code so that
	users can run it on count data from RNA-seq.
